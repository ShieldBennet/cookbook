 * Metaphor: Call takeaway -- you don't need to know

 * just take a phone(involve simple factory), 
 * the food(object) is ready for you.
 * Core: create a method/function which
 * 1. accept relative simple parameter
 * 2. return a object of certain class
 * to hide the complex initiate logic of class
 * 
 * When: the initiate logic of class is complex and
