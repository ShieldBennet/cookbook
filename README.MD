# Cookbook

A collection of my code snippets.

## Projects structure

Code snippets are organized by their runtime:
```
├── README.MD       --- This file.
└── node            --- Code snippets running in nodejs.
```

Currently, there is only one runtime: node.

The `node` package contains code snippets of:

- [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts)
- [monocle-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/monocle-ts).
- [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts)
- [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)
- [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)

and more.
